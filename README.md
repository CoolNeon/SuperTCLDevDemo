# SuperTCLDevDemo
Example code for the Total Control Lighting Developer Shield

This sketch combines several TCL examples into a single program that when
uploaded to an Arduino with a Cool Neon TCL Developer Shield allows for easily
switching between modes and customizing the settings in the selected mode.  This
is the code pre-loaded into the TCL dev modules, and you can now tweak it to
your heart's content.

The four modes are:
1. Fire Strand
2. Cylon Eye
3. Color Picker
4. Rain Bling

### Fire Strand adjustments:

```
  Intensity  Warmth
   * -        - *
   - -        - -

  Speed      Length
   - -        - -
   * -        - *
   ```
